# Crabgrass: The Case for Moving Ideas to Innovation

## The Core Thesis

The value of an idea is not in its existence—it's in its trajectory. An idea sitting in someone's head, a Slack thread, or a forgotten document is worth nothing. An idea that becomes an innovation transforms an organization.

**Crabgrass exists to move ideas toward innovation.**

## The Idea-to-Innovation Spectrum

Ideas don't become innovations in a single leap. They evolve:

| Stage | Definition | What It Requires |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Idea** | A concept or thought | Ideas are cheap and abundant |
| **Innovative Idea** | An idea with novel, insightful, or strategic qualities | Insight + Intent + Connection |
| **Innovation** | An idea that survives contact with reality and delivers value | Execution + Adoption + Impact |

The critical insight: **most ideas never leave stage one.** They remain unconnected, ungrounded, and eventually forgotten. Organizations don't suffer from a shortage of ideas—they suffer from an inability to move ideas through this spectrum.

## The Transformation Gap

What transforms an idea into an *innovative* idea?

1. **Insight** — This is the irreplaceable human contribution. LLMs are extraordinarily capable tools, but they can only work with what they're given. They don't know what your customer said last week, what your engineer noticed in the logs, or what your sales team is hearing in the market. Insight is the raw material humans uniquely possess—the observations, hunches, and contextual knowledge that no model can generate on its own. Without human insight, LLMs are just pattern-matching on public data. With it, they become engines of organizational innovation.
2. **Intent** — grounding the idea in an objective that matters to the organization
3. **Connection** — linking the idea to other ideas, people, and strategic vectors that amplify its potential

The **transformation is where Crabgrass adds value**. It transforms an idea into something an LLM can reason about productively - and provides us some visibility into the LLM's reasoning. "Was it a bug to alert this other user about this idea, or a feature?" By focusing on the transition (structure and intent) we can better make that determination - we can create evals.

             │                    ╱

             │                ╱
             │              ╱
             │            ╱
   Low Value ┤  ◆ Raw Idea
             │  (orphan)
             └────┴─────────────────────┴────
                Low                    High
                      CONNECTION
```

**This is the gap Crabgrass closes.**

## Beat up the LLM

LLMs are pattern-matchers trained on public data. They hallucinate. They're sycophantic—they'll tell you what you want to hear. They generate plausible-sounding output that may or may not be true, useful, or novel. And crucially, they need lots of data to find patterns.

Humans are different. We thin-slice—we recognize patterns from remarkably little information. A sales rep hears one odd comment from a customer and *knows* something has shifted. An engineer glances at a log and feels something is wrong before they can articulate why. This is intuition, abductive reasoning, the ability to leap to insight from sparse data.

LLMs are poor at this. They need volume. They need repetition. They find patterns *after* enough signal has accumulated. Humans can see the pattern when it's still faint.

The mistake is treating the LLM as an oracle. The opportunity is treating it as a sparring partner.

When you bring genuine organizational insight—things the LLM literally cannot know, patterns you've thin-sliced from fragments—you're not just prompting, you're *doing battle*. You're saying: here's what we actually see in the market, here's what our customers actually said, here's what we know that contradicts your pattern-matched assumption. Now work with that.

That's where unique value gets created. Not in the LLM's output. In the collision between the LLM's capabilities and human insight it couldn't have generated on its own.

Think of Crabgrass as a tool that helps you to **battle with LLMs** and together find innovative ideas.

## The Strategic Imperative: Why Now?

The battle today is automation. Organizations are racing to use AI to do existing things faster and cheaper.

But that's table stakes. In the near future, the competitive advantage shifts to **pure innovation**—using AI not to automate the known, but to discover the unknown. The organizations that win will be those that can surface novel value, not just optimize existing value.

This requires a different posture: **putting all employees into the innovation battle**, not just the automation battle.

LLMs are extraordinarily powerful, but they have a critical limitation—they don't know what's inside your organization. They don't have access to:
- The scattered insights across your teams
- The emerging patterns in your operations
- The strategic objectives only your leadership understands
- The tacit knowledge your employees carry

**Crabgrass mines insight from across the organization to do battle with the LLM.**

It transforms internal organizational knowledge into fuel for the AI, turning every employee's observation into potential innovation.

## Summary

**The argument in three sentences:**

1. The gap between "idea" and "innovation" is where organizational value is created or lost.
2. Closing that gap requires insight—the one thing humans provide that LLMs cannot generate on their own.
3. Crabgrass is the system that harvests human insight from across the organization and connects it to AI-powered acceleration, turning scattered knowledge into competitive advantage.

**The deeper point:**

The AI revolution has created a new scarcity. Processing power is abundant. Data is abundant. What's scarce is organizational insight—the observations, hunches, and contextual knowledge trapped in employees' heads. The organizations that learn to harvest and deploy this insight will innovate faster than those still arguing about whether AI will replace their workforce.

Crabgrass doesn't replace humans. It makes human insight the fuel for a new kind of innovation engine.

**The tagline:**

*Crabgrass: Human insight, AI acceleration. From idea to innovation.*
